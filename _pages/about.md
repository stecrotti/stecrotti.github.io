I'm a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/cmpcs/statistical_physics_and_interdisciplinary_applications"> Statistical Physics and Interdisciplinary Applications</a> group at Politecnico di Torino, Italy.
We use techniques from the statistical physics of complex systems to study optimization and inference problems across various domains: biology, computer science, epidemic modelling, and more.

During my Master's thesis and first year of PhD I have been working on approximate solutions to the [Closest Vector Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_problem#Closest_vector_problem_(CVP)).
I am now focusing on the study of atypical trajectories in some stochastic dynamics.
