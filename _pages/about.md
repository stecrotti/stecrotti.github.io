I'm a PhD student in the <a href="https://www.disat.polito.it/research/research_groups/cmpcs/statistical_physics_and_interdisciplinary_applications"> Statistical Physics and interdisciplinary applications</a> group at Politecnico di Torino, Italy.
We use techniques from the statistical physics of complex systems to study optimization and inference problems across various domains: biology, computer science, epidemic contaiment... 

During my Master's thesis and first year of PhD I have been working on approximate solutions to the Closest Vector Problem.
I am now focusing now the study of atypical trajectories in some stochastic dynamics.
